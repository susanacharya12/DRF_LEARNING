# Day 9: Nested Serializers in Django REST Framework

## Overview
Today, I explored **Nested Serializers** in Django REST Framework (DRF), a powerful feature that allows serialization of complex data structures with related models in a clean and organized way.

## What I Learned
- Nested serializers help handle relationships such as:
  - **One-to-Many**
  - **Many-to-Many**
- They make data exchange **smoother** and **more intuitive** in APIs.
- Organizing serializers this way improves code **readability** and **maintainability**.

## Takeaways
- Nested serializers are essential for **complex APIs** involving related models.
- They allow APIs to return structured JSON without extra queries or manual data formatting.
