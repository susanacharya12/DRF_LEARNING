# Day 4: Concrete Generic Views in Django REST Framework

## Overview
Today, I focused on building **clean, scalable, and powerful APIs** using **Concrete Generic Views** in Django REST Framework (DRF).

## What I Learned

### Concrete Generic Views
- Leveraged DRF’s pre-built views to simplify CRUD operations:
  - `CreateAPIView`
  - `RetrieveAPIView`
  - `UpdateAPIView`
  - `DestroyAPIView`
  - `ListAPIView`
- Combined views like:
  - `ListCreateAPIView`
  - `RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView`
- Built on top of `GenericAPIView` + **mixins**, making API development **clean, readable, and fast**.

### Mini Project Highlights
- **Expense API** using Concrete Generic Views.
- Successfully tested full CRUD operations — smooth and functional from start to finish.

## Takeaways
- Concrete Generic Views significantly **reduce boilerplate** code.
- DRF provides a **developer-friendly** and **production-ready** API structure.

## Next Steps
- Learn **Permissions & Authentication** to secure APIs.
