# Day 12: Pagination in Django REST Framework

## Overview
Today, I explored **Pagination** in Django REST Framework (DRF) to efficiently manage large datasets in APIs.

## What I Learned
- Pagination allows APIs to return **data in smaller, manageable chunks** rather than sending all records at once.
- DRF provides several built-in pagination styles:
  - `PageNumberPagination` – Splits data by page number.
  - `LimitOffsetPagination` – Uses limit and offset parameters.
  - `CursorPagination` – Provides stable ordering for large datasets.
- Implemented pagination in API views and tested responses to confirm proper page splitting.

## Takeaways
- Pagination improves **performance** and **user experience** for APIs handling large datasets.
- Essential for **scalable and professional API development**.
