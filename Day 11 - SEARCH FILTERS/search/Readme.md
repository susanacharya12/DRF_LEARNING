# Day 11: Search Filters in Django REST Framework

## Overview
Today, I explored **Search Filtering** in Django REST Framework (DRF).  
Search filters allow users to quickly search across one or multiple fields in an API, making data retrieval fast and intuitive.

## What I Learned
- **Search Filtering**: Use DRFâ€™s built-in `SearchFilter` to search model data by one or more fields.
- Enables users to find relevant data without building multiple endpoints.
- Helps create APIs that are **user-friendly** and **efficient**.

## Takeaways
- Search filters enhance API usability by allowing **quick and flexible data access**.
- Essential for building **intelligent and interactive APIs**.
