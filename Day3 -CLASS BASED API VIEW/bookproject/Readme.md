# Day 3: Class-Based Views (APIView) in Django REST Framework

## Overview
Today, I explored **Class-Based Views (APIView)** in Django REST Framework (DRF), giving me more control over each request and response while building APIs.

## What I Learned
- Created full **CRUD endpoints** (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) using `APIView`.
- Used **ModelSerializers** to reduce boilerplate and keep code clean.
- Handled **status codes** and provided **clear error messages** for better API communication.
- Organized **views and serializers** for a reusable and maintainable structure.

## Tech Stack
- Django
- Django REST Framework (DRF)
- APIView
- ModelSerializer

## Takeaways
- Class-Based Views provide **better structure and scalability** compared to function-based views.
- ModelSerializers simplify code and help maintain consistency across APIs.

## Next Steps
- Move towards **ViewSets** for faster development and automated routing.
