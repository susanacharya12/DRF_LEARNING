# Day 2: CRUD Operations with Function-Based Views in Django REST Framework

## Overview
Today, I implemented **full CRUD operations** in my API using **Function-Based Views** in Django REST Framework (DRF) and tested everything with Postman.

## What I Learned
- **GET** – Fetched data successfully from the API.
- **POST** – Created new entries in the database.
- **PUT** – Updated existing records.
- **DELETE** – Removed records from the database.
- **Postman Testing** – Verified endpoints, behavior, and status codes efficiently.

## Key Files
- `models.py` – Defines the data model.
- `serializers.py` – Serializer class for the model.
- `views.py` – Function-based views implementing CRUD operations.
- `urls.py` – URL routing for the API endpoints.

## Takeaways
- Function-Based Views allow **straightforward implementation of CRUD operations**.
- Seeing the API interact with real data in Postman is **highly satisfying** and reinforces understanding.

## Next Steps
- Explore **Class-Based Views (CBVs)** for cleaner and more reusable code.
