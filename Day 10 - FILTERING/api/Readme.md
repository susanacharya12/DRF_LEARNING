# Day 10: Filtering in Django REST Framework

## Overview
Today, I explored **Filtering** in Django REST Framework (DRF).  
Filtering allows users to fetch specific data from an API without creating multiple endpoints, making data retrieval more efficient.

## What I Learned
- **Basic Filtering**: Filter results by specific fields using query parameters.
- Filtering improves the APIâ€™s usability by allowing **dynamic and targeted data retrieval**.

## Takeaways
- Filters make APIs smarter by letting users retrieve **only the data they need**.
- Essential for building **user-friendly and efficient APIs**.
